# Introduction

Welcome to the Savvy API! You can use our API to access Savvy API endpoints, which helps you create any mutual funds usecase you like. 

We have language bindings in Shell only for now. We don't have readymade clients as of now, but they'll be coming soon! You can view shell (curl) code examples in the dark area to the right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, you must pass a Base64 encoded combination of your access key and secret key. Use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
# encoded_key = Base64.encode("ACCESS_KEY:SECRET_KEY")
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: encoded_key"
```

> Make sure to replace `encoded_key` with your own combination.

Savvy uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Savvy API key combination at our [developer portal](http://developers.savvyapp.in).

Savvy expects for the API key combination to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: encoded_key`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>encoded_key</code> with your own API key combination.
